What is a RouterEvent?

  A RouterEvent is a way of representing a conceptual event that took place in a "router" (relay or client).

  RouterEvents are used in order to collect information about a network all in one place and preserve causality.

How do I make a new RouterEvent?

  Add your event following the structure in llarp/tooling/router_events.{hpp,cpp}

  Add your event to pybind in pybind/llarp/tooling/router_event.cpp

What if a class my event uses is missing members in pybind?

  Find the relevant file pybind/whatever/class.cpp and remedy that!

What if I need to refer to classes which aren't available already in pybind?

  Add pybind/namespace/namespace/etc/class.cpp and pybind it!

  You will need to edit the following files accordingly:
    pybind/common.hpp
    pybind/module.cpp
    pybind/CMakeLists.txt
